# CPS3320-LIYI-FULEYONG
This file is a class project file--CPS3320.

This file includes two different projects:

  The first one--Speech recognition into text:
    This is a real-time speech recognition project based on Python, which is completely developed by us. 
    The code part about calling iFLYtek speech recognition API is from the guidance literature of this website.
  
  The second one--Speech-Emotion-Recognition-master:
    This is a user emotion recognition software based on Python and machine learning. 
    It analyzes thousands of voice messages to make data statistics, and finally performs real-time language emotion recognition based on the statistical data. 
    This is not code we wrote ourselves, it comes from the link at the bottom. 
    We mainly run the file for external data training code, and successfully output the training results. 
    However, an unsolvable error occurred in the prediction process (because OPENSMILE has certain requirements for GPU Settings of the device).
